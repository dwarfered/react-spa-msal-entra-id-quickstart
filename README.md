</p>

A quickstart React single-page application built with Next.js that uses MSAL React to authenticate users with Microsoft Entra ID via the authorization code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). It demonstrates how to securely sign in users and call the Microsoft Graph API, using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for authentication and Fluent UI for styling.
